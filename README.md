# ChunkFix

On servers with very small render distance, load/share chunks via a separate server.

This is the Forge client mod. You can find the server at [Gjum/morechunks-server](https://github.com/Gjum/morechunks-server).

Package the distributable `.jar`: `gradlew reobf`
You can then find it in `build/libs/`.
